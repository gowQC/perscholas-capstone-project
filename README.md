# Perscholas Capstone Project

For my Per Scholas Capstone project, I have created a full stack application that will simulate the likes of an e-commerce website. Listed here is a monolithic repository containing both the frontend and backend folder structures for my project. My e-commerce website simulations user account creation and allows for logged in users to place items in their virtual cart and push orders to be sent back to the database. Listed below are more in-depth explanations for both the frontend and backend portions of this project.
